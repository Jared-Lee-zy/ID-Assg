Design process

I made a website for the band "Queen" and I took inspiration from the bands official website with the simple color palette of black and white.
The user audience are fans of the band with their intent and purpose to find out about the dates and locations for the band's upcoming shows.
The website is catering for fans of the band and it provides many things like the history of the band, info about the members, times and locations for the live shows and shop page to buy merchandise.

Features

The main features of the website include a navigation bar, footer, history page, band page, merch page and live page.
The navigation bar is a bar with multiple buttons that can be clicked to direct the user to the page based on the button they click.
The footer has multiple buttons with popular social media logos that direct the user to the band's social based on the button they click.
The history page provides a dropdown bar where the user can select the era of Queen's history they want to learn about and text will appear for them to read.
The band page shows the four original band members and the user can hover over them to get a short description about them.
The merch page shows all the different types of merch available and there is a filter system where the user can click the filter to find the types of merch they want to see.
The live page just shows the band's live shows date and location.


Technologies used

I used html, css and javascript.
I used "font awesome" to find icons for the footer bar.
